## üìò Project Overview

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **New York City Taxi Trip dataset** to uncover insights into passenger behavior, fare structures, trip patterns, and revenue trends.  

The goal is to understand operational inefficiencies, identify revenue opportunities, and support data-driven decision-making for optimizing taxi services in NYC.

## üéØ Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw trip data.  
- Identify and handle missing, zero, or negative values.  
- Analyze fare components such as tips, surcharges, and tolls.  
- Study trip distance, duration, and passenger count distributions.  
- Explore temporal patterns (hourly, daily, monthly trends).  
- Investigate geographical trends using pickup/drop-off zones.  
- Visualize correlations and relationships between numerical variables.  
- Derive actionable insights to improve operations and pricing strategies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed

1. **Data Import & Overview**
   - Loaded NYC Taxi dataset.
   - Checked dataset dimensions, column types, and null values.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicate entries.
   - Handled missing, zero, and negative values in key columns.
   - Converted datetime fields and derived new temporal columns (hour, weekday, month).

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Added new features such as trip_duration, pickup_hour, and tip_percentage.

4. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Analyzed passenger count and trip distance distributions.
   - Visualized fare and tip amount patterns.
   - Explored surcharges and their frequency by location and time.
   - Compared revenue across day vs night trips.

5. **Statistical Insights**
   - Correlation matrix and pairwise relationships between numerical features.
   - Detection of potential outliers and data quality checks.

6. **Visualization**
   - Used bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, and scatter plots for clear representation.

## üìä Key Insights

- Majority of trips have 1‚Äì2 passengers and short distances (<5 miles).  
- Nighttime trips show higher revenue per mile due to surcharge and tip behavior.  
- Zero or near-zero distances often correspond to same-zone pickups.  
- Tip percentage positively correlates with trip distance and fare amount.  
- Surcharges vary significantly across pickup zones and times of day.

4. **Run All Cells**
   - Follow the markdown explanations and execute each code cell sequentially.

---

## üìà Future Scope

- Incorporate geospatial visualization using Folium or GeoPandas.  
- Apply statistical hypothesis testing on fare and tip variations.  
- Extend analysis to predictive modeling (e.g., fare estimation, demand forecasting).  
- Automate report generation using Python scripts.
